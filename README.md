# Distributed Optimization

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and resources focused on distributed optimization, convex analysis, and consensus algorithms. The materials are organized by topic and cover both foundational concepts and advanced methods, including the Augmented Lagrangian, ADMM, dual ascent, graph-based consensus, and more. The notebooks are suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in optimization, machine learning, and distributed systems.
